### 

### *Rules.* The oral presentation consists of an initial question and answer session on technical factors, and a follow-up question and answer session (if necessary), associated with this RFQ does not and will not constitute discussions or negotiations as defined in FAR part 15. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, and solicit or allow revised quotes. The entire oral presentation will be conducted remotely via video and audio. Offerors shall not bring or present slides, graphs, charts or any other written presentation materials nor will the Government accept or receive offeror handouts.

#### b. *Part One.* Part One of the offeror’s oral presentation will consist of the offeror answering the Government’s core questions related to the technical factors identified in the Request For Quotation (RFQ). While the technical factors are identified in the RFQ, the core questions are not. All offerors will be asked the same core questions related to the technical factors. The questions are related to the offeror’s technical understanding and approach of the requirements identified in the Statement of Objectives (SOO) and quality control measures for overseeing performance. This part of the oral presentation of answers will not exceed 25 minutes, and may go shorter. 

#### c. *Part Two (only if necessary).* The Government will allocate 15 minutes for follow-up questions following the offeror’s answers to the initial core questions on technical factors. During this time, the Government may ask questions on any information that had been presented by the offeror that the Government feels is unclear or needs elaboration. The Government’s questions may differ among the offerors based on what needs elaboration. If the Government has no follow-up questions with a particular offeror, then this part of the session will not take place. The answers given in this session are part of the offeror’s oral presentation.

### d. *Location.* The oral presentation sessions will be conducted by video chat, though audio may be substituted as needed. The Government will coordinate and set up the meeting space accordingly (providing dial in or links using a tool such as Acano or Adobe Connect). 

### e. *Date and Time.* The Government will schedule the date and time of the oral presentations with each offeror after the RFQ closing date and receipt of offeror quote submissions. The Government reserves the right to reschedule any offeror’s orals date at the discretion of the contracting officer.

### f. *Participants.* Offerors may include as many participants as it feels is necessary. Offerors are advised to have technical personnel present since the Government will ask technical questions during the oral presentations. Type and number of participants included is at the offeror’s discretion and is the full responsibility of the offeror. All proposed Key Personnel currently employed by the offeror or its teaming partners shall attend the session - the Government is most interested in hearing from staff that will have a direct role in performing on the task. The letter(s) of intent and resume(s) will suffice for Key Personnel currently not employed by the offeror or its teaming partners.

> After the presentations, offerors shall provide an email to confirm attendance with names of participants to the meeting organizers.

8. Basis of Award and Evaluation Criteria
-----------------------------------------

This procurement is being conducted in accordance with FAR Subpart 8.4, Federal Supply Schedules. This is not a FAR Part 15, Contracting by Negotiation, procurement. All submissions in response to this RFQ are considered quotations and not proposals or offers, even if labeled as such. The offerors agree to and are bound by all instructions, procedures and rules of this RFQ. The Government is not obligated to determine a competitive range, conduct discussions, solicit final revised quotations, and use other techniques associated with FAR part 15. The contracting techniques associated with FAR Part 15 do not apply.

The final award for this requirement will be based on best-value principles, utilizing the trade-off process. Accordingly, award will be made to the responsible and technically acceptable offeror whose quotation provides the greatest overall value to the Government, price and other factors considered.

The Government is more concerned with obtaining superior technical and management capabilities than with making awards at the lowest overall price to the Government. However, the Government will not make awards at a significantly higher overall price to achieve slightly superior technical value. Offerors are advised that the technical evaluation factors combined are significantly more important than price.

1.  *Evaluation Process.* The Government intends to utilize a multi-phased approach for this procurement as described below. To be considered for award, offerors must successfully pass through each phase.

> **Phase 1**: Quote Compliance Check - A compliance check will be conducted to ensure that offerors submit a complete technical quotation and a price quotation following the instructions set on this RFQ letter.
>
> **Phase 2:** Technical Compliance Check - Review of written Technical Proposal and Oral Presentations. The Offeror’s written technical proposal and responses to questions asked during the Oral Presentations will be evaluated based on an assessment by the Government technical evaluation team of their strengths, weaknesses, and risks associated with the technical factors.

### b. *Technical Evaluation Factors.* The Government will evaluate Phase 2 for an offeror’s performance or capability acceptability based on the following non-price technical factors which are of equal importance to each other:

-   **Technical Understanding and Approach:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s technical approach: level of knowledge, technical expertise, and overall understanding of the requirement. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s skills with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods.

-   **Key Personnel:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s proposed staffing methodology and skill levels/labor categories as well as the availability and relevant work experience demonstrated by Key Personnel.

-   **Similar Experience:** The Government will evaluate the offeror’s experience in performing projects of similar scope and complexity. The Government will also evaluate the offeror’s experience with open source software development, human-centered design, and continuous deployment methods. The projects must have been delivered by either a) the Offeror itself or, alternatively, b) a teaming partner that is proposed in response to this solicitation, or, alternatively, c) any key personnel that is being proposed in response to this solicitation. In the project summary, please identify how the offeror’s team was involved in the development. The summary shall include links to the public Git repository that includes the source code that was developed and accepted for the project. Actual access to a publicly available Git repository is considered more responsive than private repositories. The summary should also include active live links of the final product or current staging environment.

###  c. *Price Evaluation Factors.* Each offeror’s price quotation will be evaluated separately from the technical quotation and oral interview. The Government will evaluate the offeror’s pricing schedule as well as pricing narrative after the Oral Interview to ensure that the offered price is fair, reasonable, and realistic. Pricing shall reflect reasonableness, consistency with industry standards, and be in compliance with rates and terms and conditions of the aBPA. Note that as submissions become more technically equal in their merit, the evaluated price becomes more important. Therefore, provide your best discounted rates.

> d. *Scoring Plan*
>
> Based upon the Government’s evaluation of each proposal’s technical strengths, weaknesses, and risks, the Government will provide a narrative ordinal ranking of each proposal received in terms of the highest to lowest ranked technical proposals.
>
> For this narrative ranking, the Government will base its descriptions of strengths, weaknesses, and risks on the following definitions. A strength is defined as an attribute that, within the confines of the evaluation criteria provided above, would raise the evaluation for a factor above neutral. A weakness is defined as an attribute that, within the confines of the evaluation criteria provided above, would reduce the evaluation for a factor below neutral. A risk is defined as an attribute that creates the probability for an adverse impact on performance, functionality, or another technical aspect of a proposal that may be low, moderate, or high. A risk may be present with either a strength, weakness, or independently to the degrees listed.

Following the ranking of technical proposals, price will be introduced and a best value decision will be made. The Government will provide a brief explanation in accordance with FAR 8.405-2(d) to unsuccessful offerors upon timely request.
