### SUBJECT: NONDISCLOSURE/CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT

The proper custody, use and preservation of official information related to acquisitions (pre-solicitation information, solicitation information, validation, evaluation, source selection proceedings, exchanges, discussions, etc.) cannot be overemphasized. It is essential that all personnel associated with the procurement actions as an activity representative strictly comply with the applicable provisions of governing regulations and statutes including, but not limited to Section 1905 of Title 18, United States Code.

Section 1905 of Title 18, United States Code, provides for the following:

Whoever, being an officer or employee of the United States or of any department or agency thereof, any person acting on behalf of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or agent of the Department of Justice as defined in the Antitrust Civil Process Act (15 U.S.C. 1311-1314), publishes, divulges, discloses, or makes known in any manner or to any extent not authorized by law any information coming to him in the course of his employment or official duties or by reason of any examination or investigation made by, or return, report or record made to or filed with, such department or agency or officer or employee thereof, which information concerns or relates to the trade secrets, processes, operations, style of work, or apparatus, or to the identity, confidential statistical data, amount or source of any income, profits, losses, or expenditures of any person, firm, partnership, corporation, or association; or permits any income return or copy thereof or any book containing any abstract or particulars thereof to be seen or examined by any person except as provided by law; shall be fined under this title, or imprisoned not more than one year, or both; and shall be removed from office or employment.

It is understood that it may be necessary for you to obtain, generate, or access confidential commercial or financial information, as well as sensitive Government information, including but not limited to confidential commercial or financial data obtained from or contained in vendor submitted documents and proposals. Furthermore, by signing this document, you acknowledge that unless otherwise authorized, the release of information of this type shall be at the sole discretion and direction of the Contracting Officer, consistent with applicable laws and regulations.

Unless otherwise authorized by the Contracting Officer (or designee) or appropriate legal authority, you shall not disclose or reveal any information to anyone not also cleared for access (and then only on a strict need to know basis) which:

1.  Would provide undue or discriminatory advantage to an offeror or other private interest (including information contained in vendor proposals and the identity or number of offerors).

2.  Is or reflects confidential commercial or proprietary information submitted by an offeror or which could reasonably be expected to cause competitive harm to an offeror.

3.  Is protected under the Freedom or Information act, the Privacy Act, or other authority.

4.  Pertains to internal agency communications regarding the procurement (including source selection plan, source selection evaluation board reports, technical analyses, and recommendations).

5.  Has been designated “Source Selection Sensitive” or “For Internal Use Only.”

If furnished with an offeror’s proposal for evaluation, you shall:

1.  use the information contained therein only for evaluation purposes;

2.  comply with any restrictive notice which may have been placed on the proposal by its originator or the Contracting Officer;

3.  upon completion of the evaluation, return all copies of the proposal and abstracts, if any, to the GSA Contacting Officer who initially furnished the proposal for evaluation;

4.  Not contact the originator of the proposal concerning any aspect of its contents.

By signing this document, you acknowledge that you are aware that the unauthorized disclosure of procurement information may subject you to criminal, civil, or administrative penalties.

Furthermore, and to the best of your knowledge, you affirm that neither you nor any member of your family have any direct financial or employment interest in any of the firms that may submit or have submitted proposals for consideration and evaluation, which conflicts substantially, with your duties during the acquisition of the *Task Order Number ID11160063 for General Services Administration (GSA), Technology Transformation Team (TTS), Forest Service e-Permitting Application Protocol Interface (API)*. In the event that you later become aware of such conflict of interest, you agree to disqualify yourself and report this fact to the Contracting Officer and shall abide by any instructions which he/she may give you in this matter.

The undersigned acknowledges that they have read and understand the contents of this document.
